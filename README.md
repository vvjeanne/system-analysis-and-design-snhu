# system-analysis-and-design-snhu
A portfolio of projects completed and progress made throughout CS255 at SNHU<br><br>

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?<br>**
DriverPass was a client seeking a web-based driver education management system to help students better prepare for DMV driving tests. The system needed to support online practice exams, instructional content, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, reporting, and role-based access for customers, staff, management, and IT administrators. The goal was to centralize operations and improve student pass rates.<br><br>

**What did you do particularly well?<br>**
I clearly translated the interview transcript into structured business and functional requirements. I also developed detailed UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams) that accurately modeled user roles, workflows, and system interactions, ensuring traceability between requirements and system design.<br><br>

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<br>**
If I revised one part, I would refine the nonfunctional requirements by adding more measurable performance metrics (such as specific response time thresholds or uptime percentages). This would make the requirements more testable and aligned with real-world implementation standards.<br><br>

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<br>**
I focused on DriverPass’s main concern, students failing DMV exams due to poor preparation, and translated that into features like practice testing, progress tracking, structured lesson scheduling, and reporting. I implemented role-based access controls to reflect real operational workflows. Considering user needs is essential because the system must directly solve the client’s business problem while remaining usable, secure, and efficient for all roles.<br><br>

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?<br>**
I began with requirement analysis from the stakeholder interview, then applied both process modeling (activity and sequence diagrams) and object modeling (class diagrams) to fully understand system behavior and structure. In the future, I would continue using structured requirement gathering, UML modeling, role-based design, and validation of functional and nonfunctional requirements to ensure scalable and user-centered system design.
